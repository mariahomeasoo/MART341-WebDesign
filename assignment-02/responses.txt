The World Wide Web are the web pages you see when you're online. The Internet is the network of connected computers that the World Wide Web works on. 
The best way I can describe how the Internet works is by moving data from one place to another. The data is broken up into smaller pieces then they are sent to the router. The router helps transfer the little data pieces to where they need to go. Once those pieces reach their destination they are reassembled into what you sent, for example an email or a message. 
A directory is a collection of different files organized into groups. Directories are hierarchial and use familial terms to describe relationships. "Child", "parent", "grandparent", and "great-grandparent" can be used. In a immediate directory tree, the active directory is the parent of the subdirectory. 
A version control system (VCS) is a way to remember the changes you made. VCS will benefit me by tracking any changes I make to a file. I can go back and make changes to see if they work or not. I can also share and collaborate with others using VCS. 
I think my favorite kind of art is a tie between visual and performing. My dad is an artist so I'm a big fan or painting and drawing. I love music and dance as well.
