    <h1>Lyrics</h1>
    <p>Oh, oh, oh-oh
      Oh, oh, oh-oh
      Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
    </p>
    <p>We couldn't turn around
      'Til we were upside down
      I'll be the bad guy now
      But no, I ain't too proud
    </p>
    <p>I couldn't be there
      Even when I tried
      You don't believe it
      We do this every time
    </p>
    <p>Seasons change and our love went cold
      Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
      Run away, but we're running in circles
      Run away, run away
    </p>
    <p>I dare you to do something
      I'm waiting on you again
      So I don't take the blame
      Run away, but we're running in circles
      Run away, run away
    </p>
    <p>Let go
      I got a feeling that it's time to let go
      I say so
      I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
    </p>
    <p>You thought that it was special, special
      But it was just the sex though, the sex though
      And I still hear the echos (the echoes)
      I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go
    </p>
    <p>Seaons change and our love went cold
      Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
      Run away, but we're running in circles
      Run away, run away
    </p>
    <p>I dare you to do something
      I'm waiting on you again
      So I don't take the blame
      Run away, but we're running in circles
      Run away, run away
    </p>
    <p>Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
      It's only me
      What you got to lose?
      Make up your mind, tell me
      What are you gonna do?
      It's only me
      Let it go
    </p>
    <p>Seasons change and our love went cold
      Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
      Run away, but we're running in circles
      Run away, run away
    </p>
    <p>I dare you to do something
      I'm waiting on you again
      So I don't take the blame
      Run away, but we're running in circles
      Run away, run away, run away
