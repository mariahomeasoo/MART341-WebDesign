While browsing the web I come across a lot of drop down box, text entry, radio checkmark, password input, and button forms. Most drop down boxes I see usually ask me to choose what state I'm from. Text entry forms I come across all the time ask for my username, email, phone number, and etc,. Radio checkmark forms I see usually have to do surveys, one that I can remember from off the top of my head is age group. Submit button forms I see all the time. Forms are used by developers to collect information and data from users.

Text Form Examples:
Text box: lets users type in information like usernames.
Text area: similar to a text box but it lets users enter longer responses.
Selection Form Examples:
Dropdown Select: allows users to select an option from a dropdown list
Radio Button: it's a multiple choice question and lets users pick one option
Button Forms Examples:
Submit: sends a form to a user
Image: it's a submit button but you can use a picture. I don't really see these forms.

My success this week is that I got my homework done early this week. I've been pretty busy these last couple of weeks and so I put off my homework for this class until the weekend. This week I struggled a little with with the input elements. There's a lot of them being thrown at us at once so for me it's a little overwhelming. I didn't get to play around with them as much as I wanted to this week. I think if I experiment with them more I'll get more comfortable. I overcame my fear of input elements by including them in my homework.
