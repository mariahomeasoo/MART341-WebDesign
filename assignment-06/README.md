Head elements include meta, viewport, title, link, and style. The meta element contains information about the webpage. Charset, description, and author were the meta elements we learned about this week. The viewport helps display the page on mobile devices. The title element defines the title of a document and is the only required element in the head. The link element tells a browser about any other resources the page might need to load. Finally the style element establishes the page style. Body elements include structural and semantic markup. Structural markup adds structure to the document. There are a couple structural markup elements. Meanwhile semantic markup is used to reinforce the information in a document.

This week I really didn't run into any problems and challenges. I'm getting pretty comfortable with html, so that's a plus.
