      The story of Star Boy came from the Blackfeet. Star Boy was the son of Morning Star and an earthly bride. He was banished from the Sky World for his mother's disobedience and bore a mysterious scar on his face, the symbol of the Sun's disapproval.

    As Star Boy grew, he come to love the chief's daughter, and it was she who helped him find the courage to journey to the Sky World and make peace with the Sun. The Sun not only lifted the scar but sent Star Boy back to Earth with the sacred knowledge of the Sun Dance, a ceremony of thanks for the Creator's blessing.
